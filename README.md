# Mutable File System Gateway

This repository contains the server-side implementation of our decentralized file system gateway. It's designed to provide a public, uncensored file system that can be accessed via the web for individuals wanting to share their data. The backend interfaces with multiple decentralized storage platforms and provides key services to manage data effectively and securely.

In its final stage, this project is envisioned to become a dynamic directory of decentralized, publicly accessible user files available to the entire world. These files will be available to all projects that use the node and are immune to censorship. This is not just a technical project, but a step towards a more transparent and accessible digital world. Harnessing the power of decentralized technologies, we aim to put the control of data back into the hands of users.


## Features

1. **Mempool:** Holds user operations on their file systems before they're included in the smart contract and uploaded to storage.

2. **Gateway:** Manages data uploads to storage through public gateways, eliminating the need for users to install nodes/extensions. This component can be replaced in projects using other file gateways.

3. **Rollup:** Aggregates all user changes over a specific period into a single hash, stored in a smart contract at regular intervals. This method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with smart contract modifications, potentially saving users a substantial amount of money.

4. **Appchains:** The combination of the backend and file system allows services to build Appchains for data storage. As the project evolves, these data Appchains will be interconnected in a decentralized manner.

The server-side implementation is designed to work seamlessly with our [Decentralized File System](https://github.com/FairJournal/file-system), providing an end-to-end solution for creating a public, decentralized file system.

## Roadmap

- [x] ✅ POC of mempool
- [x] ✅ POC of gateway
- [x] ✅ POC of rollup
- [x] ✅ POC with the ability to create a file system specific for an app
- [ ] Add multi-storage capability, backup user's data to different storages
- [ ] Wrap the project in the form of a node with the same features, should work on mobile
- [ ] Write a smart contract for storing file system changes for all users across projects
- [ ] Find a blockchain home for the smart contract
- [ ] Implement decentralized database distribution for user's updates
- [ ] Implement incentives for nodes which store and validate the data
- [ ] Enable the ability to incentivize not only directly by the user, but by Appchains and third parties
- [ ] 🎉 🌎 Become a worldwide directory of public user files


## API

### GET /v1/fs/user/info

This endpoint checks if a user exists in the file system.

**URL parameters:**

- `address`: The address of the user.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "address": "<address>",
  "isUserExists": "<boolean>"
}
```

---

## GET /v1/fs/user/get-update-id

This endpoint gets the current update ID for a user.

**URL parameters:**

- `address`: The address of the user.

  "address": "<address>",
  "updateId": "<number>"
}
```

---

### POST /v1/fs/blob/upload

This endpoint handles the uploading of a file, uploads it to the storage, inserts its metadata into a cache database to speed up the gateway, and returns the file info.

{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {
    "reference": "<reference>",
    "mime_type": "<mime_type>",
    "sha256": "<sha256>",
    "size": "<size>"
  }
}

```

### GET /v1/fs/blob/get-article

This endpoint retrieves a full article based on the user's address and the article's slug.

**URL parameters:**

- `userAddress`: The address of the user.
- `slug`: The slug of the article.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "userAddress": "<userAddress>",
  "article": {
    "slug": "<slug>",
    "data": "<data>",
    "preview": "<data>"
  }
}

```

---

### GET /v1/fs/blob/get-articles

This endpoint retrieves all the articles of a user.

**URL parameters:**

- `userAddress`: The address of the user.

  "articles": [
    {
      "slug": "<slug>",
      "data": "<data>",
      "preview": "<data>"
    },
    // ... more articles
  ]
}

```

---

### GET /v1/fs/blob/get-path-info

This endpoint retrieves the info of a specific path for a user.

**URL parameters:**

- `userAddress`: The address of the user.
- `path`: The path to retrieve info for.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "userAddress": "<userAddress>",
  "path": "<path>",
  "data": "<data>"
}
```

---

### POST /v1/fs/update/apply

This endpoint applies an update action to the file system.

**Form data:**

- An `update` object that includes the update data.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```
